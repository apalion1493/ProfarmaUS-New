            <h5>General Information</h5>
            <p>We collect, process and store data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
              <br>
              The information stored will not be sold or used for any other purposes than ensuring the best service
              possible.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Protection of Personal Data</h5>
            <p>Legislation requires that your personal information be kept secure and confidential. We store your
              personal information on highly secure servers located in controlled facilities. Our security is regularly
              checked to ensure that user information is handled securely, always taking your rights as a user into
              account. However, we cannot guarantee 100% security for data transmissions over the internet. This means
              there is a risk that unauthorized parties may gain access to information during electronic transmission
              and storage. Therefore, your personal information is submitted at your own risk. In the event of a
              security breach posing a high risk to you, such as discrimination, ID theft, financial loss, loss of
              reputation, or other significant inconveniences, we will notify you of the breach as soon as possible.
              We have adopted internal information security guidelines to protect your personal information. These
              guidelines include measures that prevent unauthorized disclosure and access to your information. Regular
              backups are performed to avoid data loss, and we use encryption to protect the confidentiality and
              authenticity of your data during transmission.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Personal data is continuously deleted or anonymized when the purpose for which it was collected has been
              fulfilled.
              <br>
              Due to the rapid development of the internet, changes in our processing of personal data may be necessary.
              Therefore, we reserve the right to update and amend these personal data processing guidelines. If changes
              are made, the “last updated” date at the bottom of the page will be revised. In the case of substantial
              changes, we will notify you with a visible notice on our website.</p>

            <p>When you visit profarma-direct.com, cookies are stored on your computer. A cookie is a small text file
              placed in your browser to recognize your computer on subsequent visits. Our cookies do not store personal
              information. <br>
              Almost all websites use cookies. They are used to help analyze how the website is used, aiming to improve
              the user experience. In many cases, cookies are necessary to provide certain services on the website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The information in your cookies is transmitted between your browser and a web server, containing details
              about user settings, login, and website usage.
              <br>
              Some cookies are temporary and expire at the end of the user session when the browser is closed (session
              cookies). Others are stored on your device for a longer period (persistent cookies). When you revisit a
              website, new session cookies are placed in temporary memory, while persistent cookies are updated.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Your Rights</h5>
            <p>As an individual, you have the right to be forgotten according to the GDPR. This means you have the right
              to have your data deleted 'without undue delay'. If you wish to delete your personal information, we will
              remove all information that we are not legally required to retain.</p>
            <p>If the processing of your personal data is based on your consent as an existing customer, you may
              withdraw this consent at any time, either in whole or in part. Personal data pertaining to potential new
              customers is collected only after obtaining consent and is deleted upon withdrawal of that consent.
              Data pertaining to former customers is deleted 5 years after the end of the customer relationship, but not
              before the resolution of any pending cases or fulfillment of any outstanding obligations (e.g., warranty
              claims).</p>
            <p>You also have the right to access the data that Profarma Direct has collected about you. If you wish to
              delete your data, please contact us at the following email:<a href="mailto:info@profarma-direct.com">info@profarma-direct.com</a>
